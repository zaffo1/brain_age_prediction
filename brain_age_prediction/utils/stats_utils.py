    :rtype: float

    This function performs a permutation test to
    estimate the empirical p-value for the difference in means between two groups.
    The observed test statistic is the difference in means between group2 and group1.

    The function generates permuted test statistics by randomly permuting
    the data between the two groups and calculates the difference in means for each permutation.
    The empirical p-value is then calculated as the proportion
    of permuted differences in means that are greater than
    or equal to the observed difference in means.
