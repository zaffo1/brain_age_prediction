# DATASET used for the project
Data used are taken from the ABIDE I and II datasets.
Since data are "confidential", only limited samples are here reported (we report only data relative to the first 10 of the 1383 subjects considered)

- The file "sample_Harmonized_structural_features.csv" contains structural features of the subjects
- The file "sample_Harmonized_functional_features.csv" contains functional features of the subjects
  - In particular, it contains 5253 functional connectivity features corresponding to a numberical label from '0' to '5252'.
  - The file "Functional-conn.xlsx" serves to understand what those labels mean. Each number correspond to the two ROIs (Regions of Interest) between which the connectivity is computed. A total of N = 103 ROIs were considered, corresponding to $\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ non-redundant feature values, equal to 5253 indeed.
